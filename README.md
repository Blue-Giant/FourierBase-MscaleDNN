# Ideas
This work is used to solve a class of multi-scale pde problems by means of the technique of DNN with the idea of fourier basis.

# Noting:
The codes can be implemented in tensorflow--1.14 or 1.15 under the interpreter python3.6 or python3.7

The matlab codes in 2D辅助matlab代码/p=2 are useful for E1,E2,E3 and E4.

The matlab codes in 2D辅助matlab代码/p=3Forier_scale are useful for E5.

The matlab codes in 2D辅助matlab代码/p=2Subspace are useful for E6.
